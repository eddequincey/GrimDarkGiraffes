# Grimdark Giraffes

Just about to start watching "Black Doves" on Netflix (and having already watched "Slow Horses") I was caught by the naming convention they seem to follow (Adjective + Animal/Bird) and thought I'd try and make a quick British Spy TV Show Generator using GenAI (Co-Pilot). I do find it fascinating to see how something that I'd have done myself 20 years ago, and would have taught me a great deal about the basics of JavaScript, now can be automatically generated and with a few iterations refining the prompts (and a few manual edits with the CSS), this took about 10 minutes to complete with a logo (ok, there's still work to be done on generating correct words/spelling).

With any luck, we start pre-production on "Grimdark Giraffes" in January.
